LearnPlatform COVID-19 Impact on Digital Learning

Nelson Mandela believed education was the most powerful weapon to change the world. But not every student has equal opportunities to learn. Effective policies and plans need to be enacted in order to make education more equitable—and perhaps your innovative data analysis will help reveal the solution.

Current research shows educational outcomes are far from equitable. The imbalance was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There's an urgent need to better understand and measure the scope and impact of the pandemic on these inequities.

Education technology company LearnPlatform was founded in 2014 with a mission to expand equitable access to education technology for all students and teachers. LearnPlatform’s comprehensive edtech effectiveness system is used by districts and states to continuously improve the safety, equity, and effectiveness of their educational technology. LearnPlatform does so by generating an evidence basis for what’s working and enacting it to benefit students, teachers, and budgets.

# Problem Statement
The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.
